Trip to Rishikhesh
</h3>
<p>
Rishikesh a destination which has been blessed by the steps of devotees and pilgrims from all around the world visiting here to have an exquisite dip in the holy river Ganga and wash away all of their bad physical and mental  Karma. A place which literally defines the word peace since there are many peaceful Ghats and ashrams for you to have some alone time to find yourself in the big chaos of this world.
<br>Rishikesh is situated on the foot of <br>Himalayan Mountains which emerge as a perfect place to have a nice weekend getaway from all the bustling noise of the cities.
